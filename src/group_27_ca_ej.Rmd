```{r}
ces <- read.csv(here("data","ces3_demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=ces, aes(x=white,y= ces_3_0_score))+ 
  geom_hex()+
  labs(y="CES 3.0 pollution burden score", 
       x="% white population per census tract",
       title="Percentage of white population vs. CES 3.0 pollution burden scores \n per census tract")+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange")+

```
As shown above, there is an inverse relationship between the percent of white residents per census tract and the CalEnviroScreen (CES) Pollution Burden score.
